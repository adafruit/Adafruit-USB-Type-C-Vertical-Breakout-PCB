### Description

Throw out all those Mini and Micro B USB cables you have in a plastic bin; the next generation of USB connectors is here with USB C! You will start to see these connectors pop up on all sorts of devices as the industry moves from micro B or lightening to the new standard. Well, at least until the next standard comes out.

This is the vertical version. We also carry a classic 'horizontal' USB-C breakout here.

USB C features a symmetric/reversible connector, more data pins, and higher current output capability. But, for most developers, the pin usage you know and love from older USB will work just fine. This breakout gives you all the basics you need and a resistor configuration that mimics classic USB 2.0 for a downstream connection

The two 5.1K resistors on the CC pins indicate to the upstream port to provide 5V and up to 1.5A (whether the upstream can supply that much current depends on what you're connecting to.

For most usages, you can connect VBUS to your 5V input, GND to ground, and D+ and D- as you expect. You can monitor the CC and SBU pins to determine cable polarity or send side-band data. Or leave them disconnected.

Since this connector is vertical, we give you two identical breakout strips so it will stand flat on a breadboard, plus four mounting holes in case you want to attach this to an enclosure.
